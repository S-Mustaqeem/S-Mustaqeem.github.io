    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Mustaqeem Sayyed from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Passionate about programming, research, and continuous learning, 
      with a strong interest in mathematics. Teaching is something I enjoy, but my main focus lies in exploring new ideas, 
      solving problems, and developing a deeper understanding of technology.  
      I love traveling, playing chess and cricket, and reading comparative religion books.  
      My career goal is to grow in both academia and industry, building a strong balance between research and practical applications.  
      Strengths: quick learner, strong reasoning, problem-solving, good communication, leadership, and adaptability.
