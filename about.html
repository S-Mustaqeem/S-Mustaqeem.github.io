  <!-- ===== ABOUT ME ===== -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Mustaqeem Sayyed</strong> from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. I am deeply passionate about programming, research, and continuous learning, with a strong inclination toward mathematics and problem-solving. My journey has always been driven by curiosity—whether it’s understanding the logic behind algorithms, exploring emerging technologies, or applying knowledge to solve real-world challenges.
While I enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge, my main focus lies in exploring innovative ideas, developing solutions, and gaining a deeper understanding of technology. I believe that true growth comes from balancing both learning and application.
Beyond academics, I have a love for traveling, playing chess and cricket, and reading comparative religion books that broaden my perspective on life and cultures. These hobbies not only keep me grounded but also sharpen my strategic thinking and adaptability.
My career goal is to build a strong foundation in both academia and industry—contributing through impactful research, innovation, and practical applications. I want to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world implementation, making technology more meaningful and accessible.
<br><br>
I consider my strengths to be:

<li>A quick learner with the ability to grasp complex concepts swiftly.</li>

<li>Strong reasoning and analytical skills that help in structured problem-solving.</li>

<li>Effective communication skills to present ideas clearly and confidently.</li>

<li>Natural leadership qualities and teamwork spirit to drive projects forward.</li>

<li>High adaptability to learn, unlearn, and grow in diverse environments.</li>
